/*
 * QIHSE fabric remote job dispatch — the missing remote half of
 * ai_fabric.md build item 3.
 *
 * `FABRIC.SUBMIT` picks a best-fit node and, when that node is not this one,
 * previously recorded the job `queued` and never ran it.  This module is the
 * dispatch: the submitter mints a SIGNED CAPABILITY TOKEN naming the
 * principal, its clearance/SCI and its scope, sends the job over the
 * federation mTLS channel, and the EXECUTOR verifies the token and runs the
 * job as that principal.
 *
 * Three decisions this module implements, and the reasons they are the ones
 * implemented:
 *
 * 1. RESULT LOCATION — the executor writes its OWN result record in its own
 *    store.  It never writes into the submitter's store: there is no
 *    remote-write path here and none may be added.  The submitter PULLS the
 *    record and caches it; `FABRIC.RESULT` reads the local cache and reports
 *    the honest state (`pending-fetch` is not `done`).
 *
 * 2. FAILURE SEMANTICS — retry is permitted ONLY for a job type that
 *    DECLARES idempotency.  `keystone-ingest` writes the deterministic key
 *    `fabric:ingest:<job-id>` (a retry overwrites), and `embed` is idempotent
 *    AT THE DISPATCH LAYER because the executor dedups on the submitter+job
 *    binding: a retried RUN re-ACKs the existing result record instead of
 *    executing a second time.  The underlying embed store() call is not
 *    idempotent and is never reached twice for one binding.  A type without
 *    that guarantee is never retried, and the terminal "gave up" state is
 *    distinct from "failed".
 *
 * 3. PRINCIPAL — a signed capability token, because clearance and SCI are
 *    NODE-LOCAL (the federation has no replication hook for them) and because
 *    running the job as the executor's OWN system principal is a disclosure
 *    path: an executor with a higher clearance than the submitter would read
 *    data the submitter cannot and hand it back.  An unverifiable or expired
 *    token REFUSES the job.  There is NO fallback to a local principal, and
 *    no code path in this module derives a job's authority from the
 *    executor's own principal.
 *
 * Bounds: this module is network-facing.  Every length field in a frame is
 * attacker-controlled and is validated before any copy; the frame body, the
 * payload, the token, the replay ledger, the accept loop and the connections
 * it serves are all explicitly bounded.
