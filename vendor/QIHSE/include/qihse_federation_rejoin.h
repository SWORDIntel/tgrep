/*
 * QIHSE federation rejoin driver.
 * See docs/plans/qihse_federation_upgrade_plan.md §43 (reconciliation safety) and §10 (anti-entropy).
 *
 * F8.4 produced the ordered sequence and the rule that ownership may only be
 * published after checksums verify.  F3 produces manifests and sync plans.
 * The replication module moves records.  This is the piece that runs the
 * sequence and enforces the gates, so a rejoining node cannot skip a step by
 * calling the transfer directly.
 *
 * The driver owns ORDERING and GATING.  It does not own the wire format: the
 * caller supplies a callback that fetches the peer's manifest however the
 * deployment chooses to carry it.  That keeps the safety rules testable
 * without inventing a serialisation format for manifests here.
