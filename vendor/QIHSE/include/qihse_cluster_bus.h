/*
 * QIHSE Cluster Bus — gossip transport for cluster membership, heartbeats,
 * and slot ownership updates.  Uses UDP datagrams by default (port 16379 or
 * node.bus_port) with an optional AF_XDP fast path when QIHSE_XDP_OBJ is
 * configured and the interface is available.
 *
 * Wire format (little-endian, fixed header + payload):
 *   uint32_t magic          = 0x51424E53 ('QBNS')
 *   uint32_t message_type   = QIHSE_BUS_MSG_*
 *   uint32_t sender_index   = topology node index of sender
 *   uint32_t payload_len    = byte count of payload
 *   uint8_t  payload[payload_len]
 *
 * Message types:
 *   PING        — heartbeat, payload = sender node_id (40 bytes)
 *   PONG        — heartbeat reply, payload = sender node_id
 *   MEET        — introduce a new node, payload = node_t serialised
 *   FAIL        — mark a node as failed, payload = node_id (40 bytes)
 *   SLOT_UPDATE — slot range ownership change, payload = slot_update_t
 *   NODE_UPDATE — node metadata change (role/health), payload = node_t
 *   NODE_OBS    — third-party health observation
 *   NODE_CAP    — sender capability profile (ISA tier / NPU / GPU / RAM / load)
 *   DHT_FIND    — overlay layer 3: "which peers do you know near this id?"
 *   DHT_NODES   — overlay layer 3: up to k peers, nearest first
 *
 * The DHT pair is dispatched to the overlay (qihse_overlay.h) and is an
 * UNAUTHENTICATED peer-exchange hint: it can only cause a dial (a MEET), never
 * a membership, trust or authority change.  See the gate note in
 * qihse_overlay.h.  The roadmap for this item named "msg types 9/10"; 9 and 10
 * were taken by GROUP_UPDATE/GROUP_ACK before the DHT landed, so the pair is
 * 13/14.
