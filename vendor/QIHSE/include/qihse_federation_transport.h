/*
 * QIHSE federation mTLS transport.
 * See docs/plans/qihse_federation_upgrade_plan.md §18 (node identity and trust) and §22 (replication transport).
 *
 * The generic UWP TLS layer provides a server certificate and a session over
 * an fd, but it has no way to REQUIRE a client certificate or to read the
 * peer's — which is the whole of mutual authentication.  So federation owns
 * its own TLS context here, built on the federation CA and the three-layer
 * peer decision.
 *
 * This module also supplies the transport that the replication range transfer
 * runs over, so a peer's identity is verified once at handshake and the
 * transfer rides the verified channel.
