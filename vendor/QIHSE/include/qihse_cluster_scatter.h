/*
 * QIHSE Cluster Scatter-Gather Engine
 *
 * Provides cross-node fan-out queries for multi-model commands:
 *   - VECSCATTER: parallel vector search across all shards with
 *     Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) merge
 *   - TS.RANGE fan-out: aggregate time-series across shards
 *   - COL.SUM / COL.MINMAX fan-out: aggregate column stats across shards
 *
 * The coordinator opens short-lived TCP connections to each peer node's
 * RESP port, sends the sub-query, parses the RESP response, and merges
 * the results locally.  This mirrors how Redis Cluster smart clients
 * work, but server-side.

 * (user id, clearance, SCI, tenant).  The peer verifies it against the
 * enrolled node identity and installs the claims as the session context,
 * so a fanned-out read runs under the same principal on every shard
 * instead of unauthenticated.
 *
 * Without an identity the scatter sends no PEERAUTH and queries run
 * unauthenticated — the historical posture, kept because a non-federated
 * deployment has no enrolled identity to sign with.  When an identity IS
 * installed and the peer refuses the token, the peer is skipped entirely:
 * a claim the peer will not honour is a refused peer, not a degraded
 * query that would leak to an unauthenticated context.
