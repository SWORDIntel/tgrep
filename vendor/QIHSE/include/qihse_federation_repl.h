/*
 * QIHSE federation replication transport and range transfer.
 * See docs/plans/qihse_federation_upgrade_plan.md §10 (anti-entropy and reconciliation), §22 (replication
 * transport) and §43 (reconciliation safety).
 *
 * F3 produced manifests and sync plans: it can tell you WHICH ranges
 * diverge.  This is what moves the records and proves the range arrived.
 *
 * Two rules drive the design:
 *
 *   1. The transport is pluggable and the protocol knows nothing about it
 *      (§22).  AF_XDP is a performance optimisation and never a correctness
 *      dependency, so the protocol must be exercisable without a network.
 *
 *   2. A cursor advances ONLY after the range verifies against the manifest
 *      digest.  That single rule is what makes the whole thing resumable: a
 *      crash mid-range means that range is re-shipped, not that state is
 *      inconsistent.  Re-shipping is harmless because journal records carry
 *      event ids and the F2 request ledger deduplicates them.
